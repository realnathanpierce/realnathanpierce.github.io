I am a computer engineering major at CSUF and I am planning on graduating in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4, part 1
This was one of my favorite labs because it was challenging but still in the realm of possible on your own without looking at your notes or learncpp. I created a code that converted the measurement of volume and converted it from metric to customary.

Lab 4, part 2
I enjoyed this lab as well because it was the first time I really played around with if statements in C++. It was more conditional and I enjoyed the struggle of figuring it out even if it was with help from notes. I coded a program that was like a high/low guessing game. One player would enter a secret number and the other player would try to guess the number. They would get a certain number of attempts and the terminal would let the player know if they were too high or too low on their guesses.

Lab 8, part-1
This lab was the most fun of all my favorite labs because I was so stressed on not being able to complete the formatting. I later found out that it was just a one character space at the end of one of my lines :/. I wrote a program that allowed me to create a sandwich Mad Lib word game.
